## Introduction
Implementation of CPU Scheduling Algorithm in C++.

## Need for CPU Scheduling Algorithm
CPU Scheduling algorithm in operating system is used to decide which process get to use CPU at a particualr time
Main purpose of CPU scheduling is to maximize the CPU Utilization and minimize the response and waiting time for process.

## Terminology 
### Arrival Time
The time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.
### Completion Time
The time at which the process completes its execution.
### Burst Time
Time required by a process for CPU execution.
### Turn Around Time
Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.
### Waiting Time(W.T)
Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.
