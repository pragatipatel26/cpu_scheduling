## Introduction
Implementation of CPU Scheduling Algorithm in C++.

## Need for CPU Scheduling Algorithm
CPU Scheduling algorithm in operating system is used to decide which process get to use CPU at a particualr time
Main purpose of CPU scheduling is to maximize the CPU Utilization and minimize the response and waiting time for process.

## Terminology 
1)Arrival Time: The time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.
2)Completion Time: The time at which the process completes its execution.
3)Burst Time: Time required by a process for CPU execution.
4)Turn Around Time: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.
5)Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.
